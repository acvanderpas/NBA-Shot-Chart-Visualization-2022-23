# Welcome to my Portfolio!

My name is Alex, I am a data analyst with a background in statistics and a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights. I am proficient in data tools such as Python, SQL, Tableau, Excel, and R, and have a thorough understanding of data analysis techniques including, but not limited to, machine learning, web scraping, regression analysis, time series, and hypothesis testing.

In this portfolio, I have included some personal data projects that showcase my technical skills as well as analytical capability. Currently, you will find documents, workbooks, and dashboards created with SQL, Tableau, and Jupyter Notebook. These projects demonstrate my ability to organize, analyze, and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for anyone to understand and make informed decisions. I plan to introduce more projects to this portfolio in the near future to demonstrate my growth as a data analyst.

## Projects
In this section, you can short summaries of the listed projects for quick comprehension. For more details, please check out the documents in each respective project folder.

#### NBA API Shot Data Web Scraping

For this project, I used Python to pull all shot data from active NBA players during the 2022-23 NBA season. My objective was to compare and contrast shot tendencies among various NBA players to determine how they correlate with success. After exploration and analysis, I found that the most successful teams in the NBA feature players with high shot tendencies from behind the 3-point line and directly below the basket. Those with a greater tendency to take shots outside those areas were more likely to fall short of expectations.

#### Predicting NBA Most Valuable Player using Machine Learning

For this project, I used Python and various machine learning techniques to predict the winner of the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award for the 2022-23 season. The objective was to use NBA player stats to detemine viable candidates for the award using methods such as decision tree classifications, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors. In the end, the support vector machine model was found to be the most appropriate method, boasting an accuracy score of 0.992. Furthermore, this model accurately predicted the three finalists for the MVP award.

#### Covid Data Cleaning and Exploration
For this project, I conducted a data cleaning and exploration exercise through the use of SQL. The goal was to discover trends in the number of COVID deaths in correlation with the number of COVID vaccinations. After exploring the data, I found an exponential increase in the number of COVID deaths prior to the release of a vaccine, with the United States featuring one of the highest death rates in the world. Following the release of a vaccine, the COVID death rate slowly declined around the world, indicating the vaccine was very likely successful in immunizing the population.
